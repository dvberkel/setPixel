* If All You Got Is =setPixel=

This document is an exploration into graphics algorithms starting
with the primitive =setPixel=.

* Setting the stage

We would like to explore various graphics algorithms, but we do not
want to do that in isolation. It would be great to see how our
algorithms play out. Therefore we our going creating a stage.

#+name: dream-code.setting-stage
#+begin_src js :exports code :tangle now
var stage = new Stage(640, 480);
stage.appendTo(document.getElementById('container'));

stage.setPixel(0,0);
#+end_src

The above code is how we would want to create a new stage and set a
pixel.
